 Stich --> Basically a serverless backend solution
 This gives  : 
  1. serverless query api -> a tool sets or tools to directly database query from inside client apps.
  2. Server Functions(in the cloud-> related to js)-> like  google cloud function or AWS Lamda.
  3. Database Triggers -> that allows us to events in a database, like document was inserted and then 
     execute a function in  response to that and that function could then maybe send an e-mail.
  4. Real-Time Sync -> basically is built to synchronize a database in a cloud with that mobile offline supporting database.

Working with MongoDb
Backend Server -> Drivers(Node.js, Java, Python) or MongoDb Shell->(queries)<->(communicate) MongoDb Server->Storage Engine(File/Data Access)

JSON data converts into BSON data

{
  "name" : "MAX",
  "age" : 29
}

it converts into BSON

BSON 1. Binary data 2. Extends JSON Types(e.g more detailed Number Types) 3. Efficient Storage
